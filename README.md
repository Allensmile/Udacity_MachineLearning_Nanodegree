# Projects for Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree 

All these homework projects have been reviewed by Udacity teaching assistants for several rounds and finally approved to meet all the requirements.

## Model Evaluation
Boston housing price model from UCI data repository

## Supervised Learning
Student intervention dataset from UCI data repository. Tested many different supervised learning machine learning methods, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Tree, SVM, Logistic regression, etc.

## Unsupervised Learning
Customer segments dataset from UCI data repository. Tesed and compared K-mean method and Guassian Mixuture model. 

## Reinforcement Learning
This is the project I enjoyed the most. It is a super-simplified model of self-driving car. I applied Q-Learning with epsilon-greedy method. My trained agent's performence is 'A+', which is better than the homework requirement.
