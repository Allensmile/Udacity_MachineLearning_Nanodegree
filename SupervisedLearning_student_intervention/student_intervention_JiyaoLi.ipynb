In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "The models I chose are **GaussianNB, SVM, Descision Trees**\n",
    "- GaussianNB\n",
    "    - Strength: Very fast. Require small amount of data to train. Not much parameters to tune.\n",
    "    - Weakness: 1. Requires the features to be independent. 2. The calculated probability could be 0, if the feature is not in the training data. Use laplace smoothing in this case. 3. For continuous features. It is common to use a binning procedure to make them discrete, but if you are not careful you can throw away a lot of information.\n",
    "    - Example for Gaussian Naive Bayes applied in Healthcare: (http://www.ijcst.org/Volume3/Issue1/p19_3_1.pdf); (http://www.ijcaonline.org/archives/volume148/number6/gayathri-2016-ijca-911146.pdf) to classify breast cancer. Naive Bayes method is also widely used for spam email detection. But from the online examples from Udacity class (Intro to AI by Sebastian Thrun), if we just count the words, it should be multinomial Naive Bayes.\n",
    "- SVM\n",
    "    - Strength: 1. it has a regularisation parameter, which makes the user think about avoiding over-fitting. 2. it uses the kernel trick, so you can build in expert knowledge about the problem via engineering the kernel. 3. an SVM is defined by a convex optimisation problem (no local minima) for which there are efficient methods (e.g. SMO) 4. Compared with logistic regression, the hyper-plane of SVM is theoretically maximizing the \"margin\", thus less prone to overfitting. \n",
    "    - Weakness: 1. relatively slow. 2. many hyper-parameters to tune. 3. require knowledge about which kernal to use.\n",
    "    - SVM also has lots of applications. In the document (http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/elpwang/pdf_web/05_svm_basic.pdf), from page 297 to the end, the authors talked about its applications in signal processing, Cancer diagnosis, Gas sensing, etc.\n",
    "- Decision Tree\n",
    "    - Strength: 1. Decision trees implicitly perform variable screening or feature selection; 2. Decision trees require relatively little effort from users for data preparation. 3. Nonlinear relationships between parameters do not affect tree performance.\n",
    "    - Weakness: 1. easy to overfit. 2. have problems out-of-sample prediction. 3. problem of multicollinearity: when two variables both explain the same thing, a decision tree will greedily choose the best one, whereas many other methods will use them both.\n",
    "    - Tons of applications using decision tree as well. (http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html) shows that decision tree method can be used in Agriculture, Astronomy, Biomedical Engineering, Control System, ....\n",
    "    \n",
    "**For this problem**, the training set has 300 instances, each with 48 features. The dataset is not very large and no need for online processing. It is a binary classification problem (graduate or not). There is no reason the data is linearly seperable. According to all these reasons, I chose the **GaussianNB, SVM, Descision Trees** methods. However, these three methods are not the only suitable method for this problem."

    "    2. SGD can use either SVM or logitstic regression to design the loss function (check sklearn manual).\n",
    "    3. Compared with steepest descent or batch gradient descent method, SGD is faster (each iteration does not require all the data to calculate the perfect gradient) and is an online method.\n",

    "Among the three tested models, I will suggest choosing the SVC model, for the following reasons:\n",
    "- Training time. The training time using SVC is significantly longer than the other two models, and increases more quickly as the training size increases. The GaussianNB and Decision Tree methods are very fast. However, our training set is small so that overall the training time is all short.\n",
    "- With 100, 200, 300 training sets, SVC gives the best F1 scores. And this score may even increase as the hyper-parameters are tuned. For GaussianNB method, there is no other parameter to tune (maybe the laplace smoothing factor), which means the score will not improve. And interestingly, the F1 for testing score decrease as the training size increase. For Decision tree method, The F1 score for testing is not very stable and for training is 1. This is very likely caused by overfitting. But we can also tune some parameters in decision tree to improve the prediction, e.g. the maximum tree depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "So with our dataset, I would recommend SVC. If the dataset is too big, SVC may be too slow to run. In that case, decision tree could be the best choice regarding both computing time and score. Still, we should be careful with the hyper-parameters in decision tree method to avoid overfitting. And other ensemble method based on tree method could be even better, e.g. random forest. "

    "When we use SVC method to do classification, first, it use a big chunck of data to train a model, which is to find what combination of features and their values (in our case, 40 features, and some have discrete values, some have continuous values) is mostly likely to be related to their data labels (in our case, graduate or not). Since our data label is binary, the SVC method is just trying to make two groups of combinations of features and their values. One group will be the students who graduate, the other is the students failed to graduate. The graduated students and failed students have different values in the features, e.g. mother's job, father's job, dating or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we use the model generated from the training set, which is basically two groups in our case, to predict whether some new students will graduate or not. We already know the new students' features, e.g. father's job, surfacing internet or not, etc. The features of the new students should be the same as the features in our model. Then according to the values in features of the new students, we are able to know which group it should below in our model. Then, the label of that group will be the label we will predict for the new student (will graduate or not)\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing I want to say, this is a general process for classification problems. Without considering the specific algorithms, all the classifiers should all try to solve the problem in the same way as described above. And from our testing (The section above), we choose SVC method."

    "Reviewer asked me to give me a little bit more description about SVM method, in term of how it differs from other methods. Here is my explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SVM builds a model using the dataset we have, by drawing a seperation boundary between different classes (in our case, students who graduated vs students who did not). SVM has the advantage to put the boundary at an optimal location, in order to maximize the margin, which is the distance from the boundary to the closest data points.\n",
    "![alt text](http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/Articleimage/2014/MB/c3mb70489k/c3mb70489k-f3_hi-res.gif \"image 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sometimes it is difficult to draw the boundary in low dimentions to seperate different classes. We could use some tricks to design kernals to help drawing the boundary. The Example below shows that it is difficult to draw a straight line to seperate the labels in 2D domain, just using the X and Y coordinate values. However, by adding one more feature, $x^2+y^2$, it is easy to draw a plane in the 3D dimention to seperate the labels. \n",

    "\n",
    "3. Using the model (basically the location of the boundary) we build using SVM with the existing dataset, we can predict new data by putting them in the feature space and see which divided region it belongs to.\n"
